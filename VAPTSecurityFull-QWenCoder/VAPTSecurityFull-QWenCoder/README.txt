A comprehensive WordPress security plugin that protects against common VAPT issues including DoS attacks via wp-cron, lack of input validation, and rate limiting on form submissions.

== Description ==

VAPT Security is a robust security plugin designed to address critical VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) issues in WordPress sites. The plugin provides multi-layered protection against common security threats:

### Key Features:

1. **WP-Cron DoS Protection**
   - Rate limiting specifically for wp-cron.php access
   - Automatic IP blocking for abusive requests

2. **Advanced Input Validation**
   - Multi-level sanitization (Basic, Standard, Strict)
   - Comprehensive XSS prevention
   - Email, URL, and custom field validation
   - Regex pattern matching support

3. **Rate Limiting & Throttling**
   - Configurable request limits per IP address
   - Separate limits for regular requests and cron access
   - Automatic IP blocking for abuse patterns
   - Violation tracking and monitoring

4. **Security Logging & Monitoring**
   - Detailed logging of security events
   - Statistics dashboard for monitoring
   - Top IP addresses tracking
   - Event type categorization

5. **Performance Optimized**
   - Efficient data storage and cleanup
   - Minimal performance impact on normal operations
   - Scheduled maintenance tasks

6. **Domain Control Features**
   - Hidden Domain Control Page for Superadmin
   - OTP Authentication integration
   - License management

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this protect against wp-cron DoS attacks? =

The plugin intercepts requests to wp-cron.php and applies rate limiting. IPs that exceed the configured threshold are temporarily blocked.

= What level of input validation should I use? =

- **Basic**: Minimal sanitization, allows most characters
- **Standard**: Balanced approach, removes most harmful content
- **Strict**: Maximum security, removes all but essential characters

= How often is log data cleaned up? =

Security logs and rate limiting data are automatically cleaned up:
- Hourly cleanup of temporary data
- Daily cleanup of older records
- Logs older than 30 days are automatically removed

= How do I test the security features? =

Detailed testing instructions are available in the FEATURES.md file included with the plugin. You can also use the test-vapt-features.php script for easy testing, or refer to the Test URL information shown in the plugin settings.

= Can I customize the plugin behavior? =

Yes, you can create a `vapt-config.php` file in your WordPress root directory to customize feature behavior, test URLs, whitelisted IPs, and more.
