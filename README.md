Create a WordPress Plugin, to fix the VAPT issues especially the one's being listed below: 
1. DOS Attack via wp-cron.php,
2. Lack of Input Validation and
3. Rate Limiting on Form Submission 

While actually implementing the plugin, please ensure that it follows best practices for security and performance optimization, besides taking into account the following Recommendations: 
1. Restrict access to wp-cron.php by implementing rate limiting or server-level access rules. Consider disabling WP-Cron and configuring a system-level cron job instead. Ensure plugins using scheduled tasks are secured and do not expose sensitive operations. 
2. Implement strict server-side input validation and sanitization for all user-controlled fields. Enforce allow lists, expected formats, and length restrictions. Use established validation libraries and ensure that validation logic cannot be bypassed. 
3. Implement server-side rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or request throttling for all form endpoints. Monitor abnormal submission patterns and block IPs exhibiting suspicious activity. Ensure form processing logic gracefully handles high-volume traffic. 


# Outdated and Vulnerable WordPress Plugins
**Recommendation:** Review all installed WordPress plugins and ensure each is updated to the latest stable version. Remove unused or unmaintained plugins immediately. Enable automatic updates and periodically audit plugin integrity and version history.
